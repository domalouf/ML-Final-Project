Hello Grader!

I will list the question numbers for HW1 and where to find the code that answers that question

Question 2
a. The ID3 algorithm is in ID3.py with helper functions in InfoGain.py
b. When CarsDataOutput.py is run, two tables are printed that correspond to the train and test data prediction accuracy (takes ~ 1 minute)

Question 3
a. BankDataOutput.py will print the table for bank train prediction and bank test prediction (takes ~20 minutes)
b. BDOReplacement.py will print the tables for the bank train and tests with replacement (also takes ~20 minutes)
Both of these files will print some progress report to show what part of the table the function is working on

run.sh will run CarsDataOutput.py, BankDataOutput.py, and BDOReplacement.py in that order

Thanks for grading!
